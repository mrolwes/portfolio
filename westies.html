        <h1>The Beginning</h1>
        <p>Yes, they are from the Highlands of Scotland</p>
      </header>

      <p>Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the Westie from his Poltalloch Terrier. They were bred to hunt rodents.</p>
      
      <p>Westies were given their current name in 1908</p>

      <h3>Rodent killers</h3>
      <p>Since they were bred to kill smaller mammals, squirrels, safely situated high in the branches, delight in teasing them into a barking frenzy.</p>

        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>Fluffy and as white as a digging dog can be.</p>
      </header>
      
      <p>Westies have bright, dark eyes that look like they are questioning you all the time. Their ears are pointed.</p>
      
      <p>Their bodies are muscular and they weigh about 15-20 pounds. </p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <p> Good natured - mostly</p>
      </header>
    
      <p>Westies are an "in-charge" kind of dog. They will chase the ball themselves if no one else will throw it. They will run and dig just for the heck of it. They are playful, but not necessarily affectionate.</p>
      
      <p>Since they respond to fast movement, small children may not amuse them. Breeders say use caution with kids and Westies.</p>
