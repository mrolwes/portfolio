        <h2>Information about Me</h2>
      </header>
      <p>I have been creating web sites since 1999 and have been teaching seventh and eighth graders basic web design for eight years. I am currently in the process of switching from being a full time teacher to a home based business so I can continue to code and travel with my husband, who is a wildlife photographer.
      </p>
      <p>My education includes a degree in English, so grammar and punctuation is covered; a minor in library science, so I have a good handle on copyright issues; and a masters in "Integrating Technology into the Curriculum"; which means I can take information and organize in ways to meet the objectives of the organization.
